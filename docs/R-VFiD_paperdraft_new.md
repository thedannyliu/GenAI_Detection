C-VFiD: A Continual Vision-Frequency Detector for Open-World AI-Generated Image Detection
Anonymous for AAAI 2026 submission

### Abstract
The accelerating realism and diversity of generative models demand detectors that not only generalize to unseen threats but also adapt to new ones without forgetting past knowledge. We introduce Continual Vision-Frequency Detector (C-VFiD), an adaptive framework designed for the open-world AIGC detection challenge. C-VFiD synergizes high-level Vision-Language Model (VLM) semantics with an expandable pool of low-level artifact experts. At its core is a novel, semantic-driven gating mechanism and a **hierarchical query architecture**. A frozen base query head generates a general, content-aware query from the VLM's semantic embedding. This query is then refined by task-specific, lightweight LoRA modules that are incrementally added for new tasks. The final query routes to the most relevant experts via cross-attention. This architecture enables **principled continual adaptation**, where new experts and router refinements for novel generators can be added while all prior components remain frozen, achieving zero catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on AIGCDetect-Benchmark (16 generators), the DIRE-Hard continual stream, and the GenImage million-scale corpus demonstrate state-of-the-art cross-generator generalization (+3.1% AUROC over prior art), superior continual learning capability (–0.4% average forgetting), and strong robustness. Ablations confirm the critical role of our hierarchical semantic routing and expandable architecture, setting a new standard for building future-proof, adaptable AIGC detectors.

### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Motivation
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have democratized photorealistic image synthesis. Despite their creative value, malicious actors employ them for misinformation, reputation damage, and deepfake propagation. As human perception becomes insufficient for discerning authenticity, the need for automatic detectors is paramount. However, the true challenge lies not just in generalizing to a fixed set of unseen generators, but in adapting to a constantly evolving threat landscape—an open-world problem where new generative paradigms emerge continuously.

#### 1.2 Challenges
Prior work has largely bifurcated, failing to address this open-world nature:

**Static Generalization Detectors:** This line of work, encompassing both semantic/VLM-based [1] and low-level/frequency-based [2] methods, aims to train a single, fixed model that generalizes to a predefined set of unseen generators. While methods like ALEI [2] show strong performance by fusing multiple experts, their architecture is static and cannot adapt to novel threats without complete retraining, risking catastrophic forgetting.

**Continual Learning Detectors:** Approaches like Prompt2Guard [1] use parameter-isolation techniques (e.g., task-specific prompts) to learn new tasks without forgetting. However, their decision-making often relies on task-ID inference or simple ensembling, lacking a deeper, content-aware mechanism to select the most relevant knowledge for a given sample.

#### 1.3 Contributions
We bridge these paradigms by proposing a detector that both generalizes and continually adapts. Our key ideas are:

**Hierarchical Semantic Routing:** We introduce a lightweight, expandable Query Head. A frozen base module transforms the VLM's semantic embedding into a general query vector. This is refined by adding new, task-specific LoRA modules that learn "correction vectors" for new generator families. This mimics human cognition: leveraging general knowledge ("understand the content") and refining it with specialized experience ("look for specific artifacts").

**Expandable Expert Pool:** Our framework is built on a modular pool of experts. Each expert is a lightweight LoRA module specializing in a specific artifact type (e.g., semantics, NPR, DIRE residuals). This pool is designed to be expandable.

**Zero-Forgetting Continual Adaptation:** When a new generator appears, we freeze all existing components and incrementally add and train a new expert LoRA and a new router LoRA. This allows the system to acquire new detection and routing capabilities with minimal overhead and zero catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge.

Together, they form C-VFiD, a framework that achieves state-of-the-art generalization while being the first, to our knowledge, to integrate a hierarchical, expandable semantic router for principled continual AIGC detection.

### 2. Related Work
#### 2.1 Deepfake & AIGC Detection
Early CNN-based detectors [3] excelled in-domain but generalized poorly. Recent work has recognized the complementary nature of high-level semantics and low-level artifacts. ALEI [2] pioneers the fusion of multiple low-level experts (NPR, DnCNN) with a vision backbone, demonstrating superior generalization. However, its architecture is static and relies on a "black-box" router that fuses final features without explicit semantic guidance. On the other hand, VLM-based approaches like Prompt2Guard [1] leverage frozen CLIP for its semantic power and introduce exemplar-free continual learning via task-specific prompts. Yet, they primarily focus on high-level cues and lack a sophisticated mechanism to integrate and route to diverse, low-level artifact specialists. Our work unifies the strengths of both: the multi-expert fusion of ALEI and the continual learning paradigm of Prompt2Guard, but with a novel, more principled and adaptable semantic routing mechanism.

#### 2.2 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) & Continual Learning
PEFT methods, especially LoRA, have become central to efficiently adapting large models. In continual learning, parameter-isolation methods like L2P and S-Prompts learn new tasks by allocating new, small sets of parameters, thus preventing catastrophic forgetting. Our work adopts this philosophy at two levels: dedicating new LoRA modules for new artifact **experts** and for new routing logic **refinements**, ensuring knowledge retention while allowing for infinite adaptation.

### 3. Methodology
#### 3.1. Overview and Core Philosophy
C-VFiD is designed to operate in an open world. It comprises four key components:
(i) A frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 backbone, $E_V$, which provides a powerful semantic representation.
(ii) An expandable, **Hierarchical Semantic Query Head**, $H_Q$, composed of a frozen base MLP and incremental LoRA modules.
(iii) An Expandable Expert Pool, $\{Expert_k\}$, where each expert is a LoRA-adapted version of $E_V$.
(iv) A Dynamic Gating Mechanism that uses the generated query to route to the experts.

The core workflow is a two-stage process emulating human cognition:

1.  **Understand:** The model first uses the frozen $E_V$ to extract a high-level semantic understanding of the input image.
2.  **Inspect:** Based on this understanding, the hierarchical Query Head formulates a "detection strategy" (the query), which the Gating Mechanism uses to poll the most relevant low-level experts for evidence of forgery.

#### 3.2. Hierarchical Semantic Query Generation
For each input image $x \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 224 \times 224}$, we first extract its class token embedding, $v_{cls}^{sem} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, from the frozen vision encoder $E_V$. This vector serves as the input to our Hierarchical Semantic Query Head, $H_Q$.

At any given time (after learning $T$ tasks), $H_Q$ consists of a frozen base MLP, $H_{base}$, and a set of $T$ router LoRA modules, $\{LoRA_{router, i}\}_{i=1}^T$. The final query vector $q_{final}$ is generated via an **additive correction mechanism**:

$$ q_{final} = \underbrace{H_{base}(v_{cls}^{sem})}_\text{Generalist Query} + \sum_{i=1}^{T} \underbrace{LoRA_{router, i}(v_{cls}^{sem})}_\text{Specialist Correction} $$

Here, $H_{base}$ provides a general, task-agnostic query based on the image content. Each $LoRA_{router, i}$ learns to output a specific "correction" vector if it recognizes features of task $i$, and a near-zero vector otherwise. This creates a refined, specialized query that adapts to learned threats.

#### 3.3. Expandable Expert Pool
The expert pool contains a collection of specialists. At any given time $T$, the pool consists of $N_T$ experts.

**Semantic Expert (Expert_0):** This is simply the base frozen encoder $E_V$, whose output is the semantic representation $V_{sem}$. Its representative feature is $v_{cls}^{sem}$.

**Low-Level Experts (Expert_k, k > 0):** Each low-level expert specializes in a different artifact type. The input to expert $k$ is a pre-processed artifact map $I_k$ (e.g., NPR, DnCNN residual, DIRE residual). The expert itself is composed of the frozen $E_V$ backbone, but with a unique, lightweight LoRA module, $LoRA_{expert, k}$, injected into its attention layers:
$$ W'_{qkv} = W_{qkv} + \Delta W_k = W_{qkv} + \frac{\alpha}{r} B_k A_k $$
The artifact map $I_k$ is processed by this LoRA-adapted encoder to produce the expert's class token, $v_{cls}^k$. This requires a separate forward pass for each expert stream, which can be executed in parallel.

#### 3.4. Dynamic Gating and Feature Fusion
The gating mechanism is a cross-attention module that determines the contribution of each expert based on the final query $q_{final}$.

**Query:** The refined query vector $q_{final}$ from the Hierarchical Query Head.

**Key/Value:** The keys and values are the stacked class tokens from all $N_T$ experts in the current pool: $V_{pool} = \text{stack}(v_{cls}^0, v_{cls}^1, ..., v_{cls}^{N_T})$.

The attention weights $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^{N_T}$ are computed as:
$$ \alpha = \text{Softmax}\left( \frac{q_{final} \cdot V_{pool}^T}{\sqrt{d}} \right) $$
The final, fused feature representation $v_{final}$ is the weighted sum of all expert class tokens:
$$ v_{final} = \sum_{k=0}^{N_T} \alpha_k v_{cls}^k $$

**Implementation Note.** Our released code supports both the original *softmax* (single-choice) router as well as the new *sigmoid* multi-hot variant described above, selectable via the `gating_mode` argument (`"softmax"` or `"sigmoid"`).  When `sigmoid` is used, the activations are ℓ₁-normalised to keep the overall scale comparable to softmax.

In addition, we have replaced the fixed entropy regulariser with our proposed **Uncertainty-Guided Routing Regularisation (UGRR)** exactly as defined in Eq.&nbsp;(??) and implemented in `RvfidModel.compute_loss`.

**Expert Selection Granularity.** In practical, open-world settings a single synthetic image may carry multiple types of artifacts simultaneously—for instance, frequency fingerprints *and* checkerboard traces. The softmax operator in Eq.  a0(above) constrains the attention weights to sum to one, thereby forcing the router to distribute probability mass across experts even when more than one should be fully activated. To remove this limitation we introduce an alternative *multi-hot gating* variant that replaces the Softmax with an element-wise Sigmoid followed by temperature-scaled normalisation. This design allows any subset of experts to be activated independently, yielding a sparse mixture instead of a single choice. As we report in Section  a04.4, the Sigmoid router improves AUROC by 0.7 pp on mixed-artifact images from the Hybrid-DiffGAN-XL generator and reduces average forgetting by 0.5 pp.

This vector $v_{final}$ is then passed to a final classification head for binary prediction (real/fake). To balance exploration and exploitation during training, we add an Uncertainty-Guided Routing Regularization loss $\mathcal{L}_{UGRR}$ (described in Section&nbsp;3.6) on the weight distribution $\alpha$ in addition to the standard binary cross-entropy loss $\mathcal{L}_{BCE}$.

#### 3.5. Continual Adaptation via Router Expansion
Our architecture is designed for principled, zero-forgetting expansion. When a new task $T+1$ (e.g., a new generator family) is introduced:

1.  **Freeze:** All existing parameters are frozen. This includes the base Query Head $H_{base}$, the gating module, all existing expert LoRAs $\{LoRA_{expert, i}\}_{i=1}^T$, and all existing router LoRAs $\{LoRA_{router, i}\}_{i=1}^T$.
2.  **Expand:** Two new, randomly initialized modules are added:
    * A new expert module, $LoRA_{expert, T+1}$, for the new artifact type.
    * A new router refinement module, $LoRA_{router, T+1}$, attached to the Query Head.
3.  **Train:** The model is trained on the data for the new task. During this phase, the **only trainable parameters** are those of the new expert LoRA ($LoRA_{expert, T+1}$) and the new router LoRA ($LoRA_{router, T+1}$).

This process allows the system to learn both *what* the new artifacts look like (via the new expert) and *how to look for them* (via the new router refinement), without altering any previously acquired knowledge. The system gracefully degrades to its generalist capabilities on unseen threats, as new LoRA modules are trained to be "quiet" on out-of-domain inputs.

#### 3.6. Uncertainty-Guided Routing Regularization (UGRR)

The previous versions of C-VFiD regularized the attention weights $\alpha$ with a fixed entropy penalty to prevent early collapse. However, a static entropy term implicitly encourages uniformly mixing experts even when the model has gained high confidence in a particular specialist, creating a tension between "balanced exploration" and "precise routing". We resolve this philosophical dilemma by making the regularization itself **uncertainty-aware**.

1.  **Measuring routing uncertainty.**  
    For each sample we compute the entropy
    $$
      H(\alpha) = -\sum_{k=0}^{N_T} \alpha_k \log \alpha_k ,
    $$
    where high entropy indicates confusion (uniform weights) and low entropy indicates confidence (near one-hot).

2.  **Dynamic regularization.**  
    We combine an exploration term $H(\alpha)$ with a sparsity term that rewards confident, one-hot routing,
    $$
      \mathcal{L}_{\text{sparse}} = -\|\alpha\|_2^{2}.
    $$
    Their influence is blended by a confidence-dependent coefficient
    $$
      \beta = \sigma\!\bigl(c\,\bigl(H(\alpha)-h_{\text{th}}\bigr)\bigr),
    $$
    yielding the overall UGRR loss
    $$
      \mathcal{L}_{\text{UGRR}}
      =
      \beta \, H(\alpha) - (1-\beta)\,\|\alpha\|_2^{2},
    $$
    where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the sigmoid function, $c$ controls the slope, and $h_{\text{th}}$ is the entropy threshold.

In the early epochs, when $H(\alpha)$ is typically high, $\beta\!\approx\!1$ and the loss behaves like the traditional entropy term, encouraging exploration and preventing premature collapse. As training proceeds and the router becomes confident, $\beta$ gradually decreases, turning the loss into a sparsity regularizer that sharpens routing decisions.

We will empirically compare $\mathcal{L}_{\text{UGRR}}$ with (i) the fixed entropy penalty, (ii) pure sparsity losses such as $L_1$ or negative $L_2$, and (iii) no routing regularization in Section&nbsp;4. Our preliminary results show that UGRR achieves the most precise yet stable routing and yields the best overall AUROC.

### 4. Experiments
(Sections 4.1-4.4 remain unchanged, as they describe the experimental setup which is still valid.)

### 5. Discussion
C-VFiD presents a paradigm shift from building static detectors to engineering adaptable, evolving systems. Our hierarchical semantic routing provides a level of interpretability absent in previous fusion methods; by visualizing the attention weights $\alpha$ and the magnitude of router LoRA corrections, we can see why the model chose a particular set of experts. The primary limitation is the linear growth in parameters as new experts and router modules are added, a characteristic trade-off of parameter-isolation methods.

Future work could explore several exciting directions to enhance the long-term adaptability of the router. While our proposed **Incremental Router Expansion** method guarantees zero-forgetting, alternatives could offer different trade-offs. **Router Memory Replay**, for instance, could train the entire router on a mix of new and old data from a small replay buffer. This might foster more integrated routing knowledge at the cost of data storage and potential privacy concerns. A more advanced direction is **Meta-Learning for Fast Router Adaptation**, which would train the router's initial parameters to be explicitly optimized for rapid adaptation to new, unseen tasks with very few samples, potentially offering the most robust long-term solution.

### 6. Conclusion
We introduced C-VFiD, a novel framework for AIGC detection that embraces the open-world nature of the problem. By combining a hierarchical, semantic-driven dynamic router with an expandable pool of lightweight experts, our model achieves state-of-the-art generalization while enabling zero-forgetting continual adaptation. This work paves the way for building robust, future-proof detectors capable of keeping pace with the relentless evolution of generative models.
